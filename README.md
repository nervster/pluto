(DEV IN PROGRESS) The idea stemmed from a bottom-up approach to savings. Other budget apps require you to create a monthly budget and money dwindles down until the end of the month, but it's been hard to use those apps because it's hard to know how much to pace ourselves per day. This app uses a bottom up approach to set a daily allowance and rolls over any savings to the next day. At the end of the month, you can either start over or roll over a certain amount to the next. A prototype that I build with Retool has allowed me and my friends to actually start saving!
